# Bear and Breakfast - Hidden Features

This mod allows you to sell items instead of just throwing them away!
This is just a quick and dirty way to get something back from all those lower tier items, that you crafted but no longer need.


## Features
- When you throw items away in your inventory, you get the price of the item back!
